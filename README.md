This action will send a pizza from Dominos to Eric or Lukas based on whichever `/` command is entered into an issue comment.

## Code in Main

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ‚úì throws invalid number (3ms)
  ‚úì wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ‚úì test runs (95ms)
...
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
const core = require('@actions/core');
...

async function run() {
  try {
      ...
  }
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
=======
This action will send a pizza from Dominos to an address/addresses stored in your secret store based on whichever `/` command is entered into an issue comment.

Example: `/order pizza person_name`

## Necessary Secrets

- `CC_NUMBER`: Credit Card Number
- `CC_EXP`: Credit Card Zip
- `CC_CVV`: Credit Card CVV
- `CC_ZIP`: Billing Zip
- `NAME-OF-FRIEND_ADDRESS`: Each one unique, but the `customer` object of the friend you want to send üçï to (see below)

## Customer Object

```json
{
  "address": {
    "Street": "745 Evergreen Terr",
    "City": "Springfield",
    "Region": "????",
    "PostalCode": 12345,
  },
  "firstName": "Homer",
  "lastName": "Simpson",
  "phone": "(123)-456-7890",
  "email": "HomerJ@MrPlow.com"
}
```


## Example 

In an Issue comment, assuming the object above is called `Homer_Address` in your secret store, run:

`/order pizza Homer`
